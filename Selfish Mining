The key idea behind Selfish Mining is for a pool to keep its discovered blocks private, thus forking the chain.So what's happening is that the honest nodes continue to mine on the public chain, while the selfish-pool mines on its private branch.If the selfish-pool discovers more blocks, it develops a longer lead than the public chain and when the public chain approaches the selfish-pool's private chain's branch in length, the selfish miners reveal their blocks.While both honest and selfish miners waste resources in this process, the honest miners are to waste proportionally more resources.The Selfish-Pool has a competitive advantage and this can incentivize rational miners to join the selfish mining pool. This happens when the selfish-pool reaches such a point that honest miners themselves want to join them so that they can reap higher revenue than other pools.So if more miners join your pool it is possible that it can become a modified protocol which ignores blocks generated outside the pool. It can become a monopolist which can launch double expenditure attacks against merchants(most of this is hypothetical and such an event occuring is rare).However it is important to note that as these selfish miners command a smaller portion of the total mining power, their private branch will not remain ahead of the public branch indefinitely.In such a scenario the selfish-miner starts mining again on the public chain waiting for a chance to start a selfish pool once more.
If you have been paying attention then a question arises; How do the Selfish Miners collect rewards if Block Races are lost ? They earn revenue by strategically withholding and releasing blocks to the network. The goal of the selfish miner is to always remain at least one block ahead of the rest of the network.
